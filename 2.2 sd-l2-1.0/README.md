# Instructions
Arrays are a simple data structure used everywhere in programming. There are many ways to interact with arrays in JavaScript.

**Today, you will be exploring arrays, and teaching yourselves different methods for manipulating them.**

For each of these tasks, type your code directly in the task file - the marking scripts will evaluate what you have written!

## Tasks

1. Use the `arr.push()` method to populate an empty array with the numbers 1 to 20, in order.

2. Use the `arr.reverse()` method to reverse the order of the given array.

3. Use the `arr.splice()` method to insert the missing number in the given array at the correct position.

4. Use the `arr.splice()` method to delete one of the two duplicate numbers in the given array.


## Extra Tasks

If you have completed the above tasks, try the following extra tasks for a bonus challenge!

5. Use `join()` on the given array to print a string of numbers from it, separated by commas only - no spaces!

6. Use `concat()` to merge the two given arrays, arr1 and arr2, in order, and then print the new array that's created.

7. A matrix is an array of arrays, representing a grid with rows and columns. Use this task to experiment with matrices!
    * Can you add a single number to an existing row?
    * Can you add a whole new row of numbers?
    * Can you remove a single number from a single row?
    * Can you reverse one of the rows without affecting the others
